Since fall 2016, I am a Ph.D. student in the Modalis team in the i3s laboratory (UMR CNRS-UNS 7271) at Université Côte d'Azur (UCA). 
My Ph.D. is about ensuring classical properties on transformations, when their definitions are not known.
I hold a position in the Laboratory council.

I also have a teaching assistant responsability in the Computer Science department of Polytech'Nice Sophia-Antipolis where I have received my master degree in computer sciences.
