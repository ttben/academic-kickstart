title: Applying Software Composition to the Docker Ecosystem
event_url: https://example.org
location: Amadeus 
summary: Supporting microservices deployments in a safer way.
abstract: "Software composition is the hidden side of the Separation of concerns coin, as keeping things separated means at some point to support their composition. In this talk, we’ll give a short overview of software composition “in the wild”, and then describe our recent contribution on the Docker Ecosystem. In this context, considering the “FROM” instruction as a composition operator, we leveraged classical linters to a new level of checking, leading to the identification of new issues (e.g., docker guideline violations) in several docker images. We will show how a simple formal model can be applied to very concrete artefacts, supporting the safe deployment of micro-services."
