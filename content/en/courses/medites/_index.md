This course is part of the [Medites project](http://medites.fr/).

This tutoring course was made for secondary school students. They build a robot (Lego Mindstorm) and write software to take actions in an emergency-situation. We focused on team work, scheduling, splitting work in small tasks, and inter-disciplinary notions. We talked about problem analysis and how to build a robot that can solve it ; how a physical phenomenon can be transformed into a measurable metric ; try, fail, analyse, and retry ; how many turns the wheels must do to reach a specific point? They saw logical structures, algorithm, notion of time, concerns-splitting, tests and try, reliability and reproductibiliy of experimental results.
