# Context and Goal

`YOU WANT TO WRITE CODE? YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE CODE.`

This course takes place in a [cyberdojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.org/). The idea is to code in pair programming, in parallel. You will solve problems in Java, in your session. To do so, and when the monitor will tell you, go with your favorite web-browser to the cyber-dojo server. Click on Enter a practice session and enter the 6digits code that your monitor gave you. You now enter into a cyber-dojo session with precises intructions. You have two sample files (Hiker and HikerTest) that are here to check if everything is running correctly :). Create a new file, and write your Java solution. Create your tests (ask if you need help to do this) and hit Test button. This should takes less than seconds, and you will see if everything went has planned (green) if tests could not be run (compilation error: yellow) or if some tests did not passed (red). Go on, and don't hesitate to test incrementally your code and expand the cases you can handle.
