#  Use Case - Inheritance explained

This course maps inheritances concepts on a dead simple example. We saw that this example was not that simple when adding inheritance. What are the pros and cons of using inheritance (in general and in this particular example), how implements it in Java, and so on.

You will find the zipped source that we collectively built in pair programming [here](http://i3s.unice.fr/~benni/facebouc.zip).

[Here are drawings](http://i3s.unice.fr/~benni/classes-explained.pdf) to visual see inheritance and concepts related
